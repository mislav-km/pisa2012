## Dataset

* The original dataset is strucutred as a table with 636 columns and almost 500.000 rows.
* As stated above I'm interested in environmental variables and how they relate to the performance of math, reading and scientific work.
* These are the columns that can help me to investigate the influence of environmental variables on learning succcess:
    
>   NC Country
>   PV1READ Performance indicator reading
>   PV1MATH Performance indicator math
>   PV1SCIE Performance indicator science
>   ST11Q01 At Home - Mother
>   ST11Q02 At Home - Father
>   ST26Q01 Possessions - desk
>   ST26Q02 Possessions - own room
>   ST26Q03 Possessions - study place
>   ST26Q04 Possessions - computer
>   ST26Q05 Possessions - software
>   ST26Q06 Possessions - Internet
>   ST26Q07 Possessions - Literature
>   ST26Q08 Possessions - Poetry
>   ST26Q10 Possessions - Textbook
>   PARED Highest parental education in years
>   HOMEPOS
>   WEALTH



## Summary of Findings

* The influence of the learning infrastructures on cognitive performance was made transparent examining the relation of a digital learning infrastructure and performance in science.
* I also tried to show that these infrastructures also can depend on social and economical variables, like the country you are coming from, the education and economical situation of the parents.
* The comparison of the top and low ten countries tried to make this clearer.
* Grouping the data by the infratructures increased the correlation of the choosen variables.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Select one or two main threads from your exploration to polish up for your presentation. Note any changes in design from your exploration step here.

* I focused on the relation of digital learning environment and the performance of scientific work in the presentation. THe loops I have used in the exploratory file weren't necessary anymore and would have been to much for the presentation.
* I loaded the data for the presentation from the csv file "pisa2012new.csv" to reduce the load time. I have created this file after the wrangling process during the exploration.
* I used a piechart in the presentation instead of the barcharts in the exploratory file for the visualisation of the categorical variable CPU
* All code and visualisations, that were not necessary to run the slide_show_pisa is removed
